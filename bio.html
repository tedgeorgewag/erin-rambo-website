					<p>In a fast paced culture, it's easy to miss the small, intimate moments that make life meaningful. That's the goal when I work, to find intimacy and capture it, both the hard and the sweet parts of human existence, to connect more with my fellow man and portray life honestly. This is the purpose of my art.</p>
					<p>My mind has always been very detail oriented; photography allows me to be imaginative with the tiniest, daily moments. I also photograph primarily in black and white as a way to capture a still moment amongst the grey of life. I appreciate the details of humanity more now that I look through my lens to find it. I hope my art allows others to do the same.</p>
